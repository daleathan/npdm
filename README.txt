	The README is a plain-text document explaining what the software is, what it does, its license, and instructions for compiling/installing/running. Additional features to this document can include TODOs, caveats, and instructions on where and how to contribute to the project. Descriptions of the program's usage (i.e. the manual) and of its innards (with the exception of recent updates) strictly don't belong here.
	Descriptions of usage belong in man(1) pages, which should be unpackaged into the user's system along with the program. The program's interesting private parts should be included in man(3) pages and on the wiki hosted on github.
