NOTE THAT THIS README DOES NOT RENDER IN PLAINTEXT ON GITHUB. IT LOOKS BETTER IN A WYSIWYG EDITOR.

	The README is a plain-text document explaining what the software is, what it does, its license, and instructions for compiling/installing/running. Additional features to this document can include TODOs, caveats, and instructions on where and how to contribute to the project. Descriptions of the program's usage (i.e. the manual) and of its innards (with the exception of recent updates) strictly don't belong here.
	Descriptions of usage belong in man(1) pages, which should be unpackaged into the user's system along with the program. The program's interesting private parts should be included in man(3) pages and on the wiki hosted on github.
	Because this project is so simple, I don't care if this is mantained as long as we have installation instructions. ( I want to be able to show this off if it ever works ) I also don't care if we have man pages. I DO care that we mantain TODOs, caveats, usage, and compiling in the wiki.
